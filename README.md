# Image Labels Generator

## Overview

The Image Labels Generator is a project developed using Amazon Rekognition, aimed at automatically recognizing and labeling images based on their contents. This tool utilizes the power of machine learning to accurately identify various objects, scenes, and concepts within images.

## Project Features

- **Image Recognition**: The project employs Amazon Rekognition to analyze images and generate descriptive labels.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple steps to upload images, run the recognition process, and retrieve labeled results.
- **Cost-Effective**: Utilizes AWS Free Tier services, making it accessible and affordable for experimentation and small-scale usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Amazon Rekognition**: For image analysis and label generation.
- **Amazon S3**: Storage solution for images during processing.
- **AWS CLI**: Command line interface for seamless interaction with AWS services.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Amazon Web Services Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account with necessary permissions.
2. **AWS CLI Installation**: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface on your machine.
3. **Python Environment**: Set up a Python environment with required libraries (boto3, etc.).
4. **GitHub Repository**: Clone or fork this repository to your local machine.
5. **Configuration File**: Configure AWS credentials and region in the `config.ini` file.
6. **Run the Application**: Execute the Python script to start the image labeling process.

## Usage
